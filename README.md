# EDR + SIEM Threat Hunt Pack

This repository is a select collection of real-world threat hunting scenarios built using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), Microsoft Sentinel, and some Atomic Red Team simulations. Each hunt focuses on adversary behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, using live telemetry, tested evasion techniques, and practical KQL detection logic.

The goal of this project is for me to *nerd out* while building an analyst’s mindset, tackling both foundational and offbeat, lesser-known attacker tradecraft.

Each scenario is designed to be concise, one-page write-ups that walk through:
- A real technique seen in the wild
- How it was simulated in a lab environment
- What was observed in MDE and/or Sentinel
- The detection coverage and gaps
- MITRE mapping, KQL logic, and analysis

This repo reflects how I think, investigate, and communicate as a threat hunter in training — or a “wannabe,” depending on the day.
